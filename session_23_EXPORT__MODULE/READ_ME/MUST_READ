the concept of exporting module is to make our 
own kernel modules (like printk , copy_from_user)




so we will export them using: EXPORT_MODULE( funcName)
in the init file global space

so when our driver is inserted using insmode it will also export this module inside the kernel
and it will become the part of the kernel.

and make the function declaration in declaration.h
void funcName(void); 


and make a file for this function and put its defination in it.
void funcName(void) 
{

}


now we can call this function anywhere and write any logic inside it .
